# Rust Programming Practice Tasks

## 1. Variable Shadowing with Types
   - **Task 1:**
     Write a program where you define a variable `distance` initially as an integer (representing meters). Then, shadow this variable by converting the distance to kilometers (floating-point). Print both values using the same variable name (`distance`) to demonstrate type shadowing.

## 2. Ownership and Returning Ownership
   - **Task 2:**
     Create a function called `process_text` that takes ownership of a `String`, modifies it, and returns it. In `main`, create a `String` variable, pass it to `process_text`, then try to use it again. Observe how ownership transfer affects the variableâ€™s usability and resolve it by returning ownership from the function.

## 3. Borrowing with Multiple References
   - **Task 3:**
     Write a program where a `String` variable `greeting` is borrowed immutably by two separate functions, each modifying it slightly but only printing their changes without altering the original `String`. Ensure both functions can access `greeting` simultaneously without mutable borrowing.

## 4. Working with Arrays and Slices
   - **Task 4:**
     Implement a function called `slice_average` that takes a slice of integers (`&[i32]`) and returns the average as an `f64`. Call this function with an array and print the result. Handle cases where the slice might be empty by returning `None`.

## 5. String Manipulation with Case Conversion
   - **Task 5:**
     Create a function `standardize_case` that takes a `String`, converts all characters to lowercase, and removes punctuation. For example, `"Hello, WORLD!!"` should become `"hello world"`. Test this function with different input strings and print the results.

## 6. Random Numbers with Conditional Filtering
   - **Task 6:**
     Write a program that generates ten random numbers between 1 and 100, then filters out the even numbers, printing only the odd numbers. Use conditional logic and iteration to handle this filtering.

## 7. Error Handling with Parsing
   - **Task 7:**
     Write a program that prompts the user to input a series of floating-point numbers separated by commas. Parse the input into a vector of `f64` numbers, handling any parsing errors gracefully. If parsing fails for any item, display an error message and skip that item.
