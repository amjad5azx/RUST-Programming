# Rust Programming Tasks

## Task 1: Math Operations and Data Types
Write a Rust program that:
- Prompts the user for two numbers, one integer and one floating-point.
- Perform the following operations:
  - Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division, and Modulus for both types.
  - Print results in a formatted manner (use precision for floats and appropriate padding for integers).
  - Convert between integer and floating-point and demonstrate the result.

## Task 2: Working with Arrays and Tuples
Create a Rust program that:
- Initializes an array of 10 integers and a tuple containing an integer, a float, and a character.
- Perform the following:
  - Replace a few values in the array and print the updated array.
  - Access and print each value from the tuple using both tuple indexing and destructuring.
  - Calculate the sum of all values in the array, find the minimum, maximum, and mean, and display them.

## Task 3: Bitwise and Boolean Operations
Create a Rust program that:
- Initializes two integer variables with binary values.
- Perform bitwise operations (AND, OR, XOR, NOT, Left Shift, Right Shift) on them and print the results in both binary and decimal format.
- Use boolean variables to perform basic boolean logic operations (AND, OR, XOR, NOT) and print the results.

## Task 4: Loops and Conditionals with Arrays
Create a Rust program that:
- Initializes an array of letters (characters).
- Use a loop to:
  - Print each letter until you encounter a specific letter (e.g., stop at 'l').
  - Implement a conditional expression to print whether the array contains more vowels or consonants.
  - Create a loop that calculates the factorial of a number using both while and for loops, and print the results.

## Task 5: Functions and Recursion
Write a Rust program that:
- Implements a function `calculate` that takes two parameters (an integer and a float) and returns the sum, difference, and product as a tuple.
- Write a recursive function `factorial` to calculate the factorial of a number and call this function with an input from the user.
- Write a function `apply_operation` that takes two integers and an operator (addition, multiplication, or subtraction) as a string, performs the operation, and returns the result.
- Print the results from all the function calls in a formatted way.
